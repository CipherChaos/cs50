# CS50 Python Projects

This repository includes my solutions and practice work based on [CS50â€™s Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/).  
Each project is inspired by real-world scenarios, designed to build a solid foundation in Python through hands-on challenges.
